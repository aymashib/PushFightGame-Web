          <h2>The Rules of the Game</h2>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>TO START:</strong>
            <br />
            The player with the white team chooses one side of the thick center
            line and positions the white pieces on that side of the line. Most
            players will put 4 pieces at the center line but you don't have to
            do that. Next, the player with the brown team positions the brown
            pieces on the other side of the center line.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong> TO PLAY:</strong>
            <br />
            Players take turns moving their pieces into position for an attack
            then using one of their square pieces to push one space. You can
            push pieces to a new space, or you can push one of them off the
            board to win the game. Move or push forward, backward or sideways
            (in either direction). NO DIAGONAL MOVES OR PUSHES ARE ALLOWED. A
            move can travel several spaces. A push is only one space.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN:</strong>
            <br />
            Players take turns with the white team going first. One turn
            consists of 2 MOVES (maximum), then A PUSH.
            <br />
            <br />
            1) MOVES:You can start your turn by positioning 2 of your pieces.
            Just move them on empty spaces. Move one piece (round or square) and
            leave it. Then, move a second piece (round or square) and leave it.
            Travel as far as you want on empty spaces as long as the spaces are
            connected (have sides that touch). Move all over the board if you
            like. You can move 1 or 2 pieces, or you can decide to not move any
            pieces during your turn.
            <br />
            <br />
            2)A PUSH:Now use one of your square pieces to push ONE space. You
            MUST push one or more pieces with a square piece to complete your
            turn. You can push white and/or brown pieces in any direction
            (except diagonally). If several pieces are lined up in the direction
            you are pushing, and there are no empty spaces between them, you can
            push them all one space. Round pieces cannot push.
            <br />
            <br />
            Note: Be sure each piece is somewhat centered on its new space after
            a push.
            <br />
            <br />
            AFTER YOU PUSH, put the red ANCHOR game piece on the square piece
            that did the pushing. The anchored piece can't be pushed during your
            opponent's next turn. It is the only piece he or she can't push. If
            it's in a line of pieces, none of them can be pushed if it means
            pushing the anchored piece. Once the anchor is put on another game
            piece, the piece that was anchored can be pushed again. PLAYERS
            SHARE ONE ANCHOR.
            <br />
            <br />

            <strong>TO WIN:</strong>
            <br />
            Trap your opponent so you can push one of their pieces off the board
            at either end. When one piece is off the board, the game is over.
            <br />
            There are a lot of places at each end of the board where you can
            push them off. You can also win if your opponent surrenders because
            he or she is trapped and can't get out
            <br />
