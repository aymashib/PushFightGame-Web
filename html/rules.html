            <h2>The Rules of the Game</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>TO START</strong>
              The player with the white team chooses one side of the thick
              center line and positions the white pieces on that side of the
              line. Most players will put 4 pieces at the center line, but you
              don't have to do that. Next, the player with the brown team
              positions the brown pieces on the other side of the center line.
            </p>

          <p>
          <strong> TO PLAY</strong>
              Players take turns moving their pieces into position for an attack
              then using one of their square pieces to push one space. You can
              push pieces to a new space, or you can push one of them off the
              board to win the game. Move or push forward, backward or sideways
              (in either direction). NO DIAGONAL MOVES OR PUSHES ARE ALLOWED. A
              move can travel several spaces. A push is only one space.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN</strong>
              Players take turns with the white team going first. One turn
              consists of 2 MOVES (maximum), then A PUSH.
          </p>

          <p>
          1) MOVES:You can start your turn by positioning 2 of your pieces.
              Just move them on empty spaces. Move one piece (round or square)
              and leave it. Then, move a second piece (round or square) and
              leave it. Travel as far as you want on empty spaces as long as the
              spaces are connected (have sides that touch). Move all over the
              board if you like. You can move 1 or 2 pieces, or you can decide
              to not move any pieces during your turn.
          </p>

          <p>
          2)A PUSH:Now use one of your square pieces to push ONE space. You
              MUST push one or more pieces with a square piece to complete your
              turn. You can push white and/or brown pieces in any direction
              (except diagonally). If several pieces are lined up in the
              direction you are pushing, and there are no empty spaces between
              them, you can push them all one space. Round pieces cannot push.
          </p>

          <p>
          Note: Be sure each piece is somewhat centered on its new space
              after a push.
          </p>

          <p>
          AFTER YOU PUSH, put the red ANCHOR game piece on the square piece
              that did the pushing. The anchored piece can't be pushed during
              your opponent's next turn. It is the only piece he or she can't
              push. If it's in a line of pieces, none of them can be pushed if
              it means pushing the anchored piece. Once the anchor is put on
              another game piece, the piece that was anchored can be pushed
              again. PLAYERS SHARE ONE ANCHOR.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>TO WIN</strong>
              Trap your opponent, so you can push one of their pieces off the
              board at either end. When one piece is off the board, the game is
              over.
          </p>

          <p>
          There are a lot of places at each end of the board where you can
              push them off. You can also win if your opponent surrenders
              because he or she is trapped and can't get out.
